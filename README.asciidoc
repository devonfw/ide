== Setup

=== Prerequisites
** Windows

*** On Windows you need to  *download and install* https://git-scm.com/download/win[git for windows].

*** You need a tool to extract `*.tar.gz` files (`tar` and `gzip`).
+
For example https://www.7-zip.org/[7-zip] or https://www.win-rar.com/[WinRar]. 
** Linux
*** On Linux you need to install `curl` and `git` if you don't have them already
+
[source,terminal, .text-center]
----
sudo apt-get install git curl 
or
sudo yum install git-core curl
----

** MacOS
*** On MacOS you only need to download and install https://git-scm.com/download/mac[git for mac].

=== Install

** Download the latest version of `devonfw-ide` from https://github.com/devonfw/ide/releases[here] and extract it to a folder of your choice.
+
(You can find all Releases in https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/com/devonfw/tools/ide/devonfw-ide-scripts/[Maven Central])
** Run the `setup` in this folder (On Windows you can double click on `setup.bat`)
+
A command prompt will open and the setup will start. The setup will ask for a settings URL. In case you do not have a settings URL for your project, you can just press enter to use the default settings.
** After the setup is finished, you can close the command prompt and open a new one.
** *You are done! You can now use the `devon` command in your terminal to use the devonfw-ide.*
