When you create a new key in the Windows registry, a value named "default" with data type of "String Value" (REG_SZ) is automatically created.
If you want to use a variable in the value, e.g. "%USERPROFILE%" then the REG_SZ data type is not *suitable for this. 
In this case you have to use the data type "Expandable String Value" (REG_EXPAND_SZ).

However, if you add another value with the data type "Expandable String Value" (REG_EXPAND_SZ), this cannot be named as default (name of the value). 
The already automatically created value default with the data type REG_SZ cannot be deleted.

To fix this problem, you have to create a second value with any name e.g. "Test" and the data type REG_EXPAND_SZ. 
This entry is able to be used with a variable. The next step is to export the key and edit the export file.
The export file contains two entries:

- the default Value, starting with "@=" and 
- the second entry named Test, starting with "Test=". 

Now the default Entry has to be deleted and in the second entry has to be renamed from "Test=" to "@=". 
After that the changed export file has to be imported again into the Windows registry.
The result is, you get the key with a value "default" and the data type REG_EXPAND_SZ, which is able to handle variables.

1. Open Windows Registry Editor.
2. Go to key: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Classes\Directory\shell
3. Create a new key "devon_wt_ps", a new value "default" (type REG_SZ) will be created in this key.
4. Edit default and add the value data "Open devonfw Powershell in Windows-Terminal here"
5. Create a new key "command" under the key "devon_wt_ps", a new value "default" (type REG_SZ) will be created again in this key.
6. Edit default and add the value data "1"
6. Create a new value "test" as "Expandable String Value"
7. Edit the value und add the value data 

   "%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps\wt.exe"  -w 0 new-tab -p "Windows Powershell" --title "devonfw PowerShell" -d %L PowerShell.exe -NoExit -Command "devon" 

8. Now export the key "devon_wt_ps" to your local disk.
9. Edit the export file and delete the row @="1" and rename "test" to "@"
10. save the export file.
