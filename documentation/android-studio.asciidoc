The `android-studio` commandlet allows to install, configure, and launch https://developer.android.com/studio/[Android Studio].
To launch Android Studio for your current workspace and `devonfw-ide` installation, simply run:
`devon android-studio`

You may also supply additional arguments as `devon android-studio «args»`.
These are explained by the following table:

== plugins

To be productive with Android Studio you need plugins.
Of course `devonfw-ide` can automate this for you:
In your link:settings.asciidoc[settings] git repository create a folder https://github.com/devonfw/ide-settings/tree/master/android-studio/plugins[android-studio/plugins] (click this link to see more examples and see which plugins come by default).
Here you can create a properties file for each plugin.
This is an example https://github.com/devonfw/ide-settings/blob/master/android-studio/plugins/asciidoc.properties[scala.properties]:
```
plugin_id=org.asciidoctor.intellij.asciidoc
plugin_active=false
```

The variables are defined as following:

* `plugin_id` defines the unique ID of the plugin to install.
If you want to customize `devonfw-ide` with new plugins use the search on https://plugins.jetbrains.com/androidstudio to find the plugin of your choice.
Select the tab `Versions` and click on a version in the list.
The plugin ID is displayed in the upper right corner.
Copy & paste the ID from here to make up your own custom config.
* `plugin_active` is an optional parameter.
If it is `true` (default) the plugin will be installed automatically during the project link:setup.asciidoc[setup] for all developers in your team.
Otherwise, developers can still install the plugin manually via `devon android-studio add-plugin «plugin_id»`.

In general, you should try to stick with the configuration pre-defined by your project.
But some plugins may be considered as personal flavor and are typically not predefined by the project config.
Such plugins should be shipped with your link:settings.asciidoc[settings] as described above with `plugin_active=false` allowing you to easily install it manually.
Surely, you can easily add plugins via the UI of Android Studio.
However, be aware that some plugins may collect sensitive data or could introduce other vulnerabilities.
So consider the governance of your project and talk to your technical lead before installing additional plugins that are not pre-defined in your link:settings.asciidoc[settings].

As maintainer of the link:settings.asciidoc[settings] for your project you should avoid to ship too many plugins that may waste resources but are not used by every developer.
By configuring additional plugins with `plugin_active=false` you can give your developers the freedom to install some additional plugins easily.
