= Pip

The Pip Commandlet allows you to install and use pip packages locally.

Usage:

* `devon pip` to install pip
* `devon pip install <package>` to install a pip package where <package> is replaced with the package you want to install
* `devon pip remove` to remove pip
* `devon pip remove <package>` to remove/uninstall a given pip package

After each installation of a new package, write `devon` for changes to take place. Not doing so might result in command being not found by the devon IDE.
