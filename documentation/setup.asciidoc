= Setup

== Prerequisites
We try to make it as simple as possible for you. However, there are some minimal prerequisites:

* You need to have a tool to extract `*.tar.gz` files (`tar` and `gzip`). On Windows before Version 10 (1803) use https://www.7-zip.org/[7-zip]. On all other platforms this comes out of the box.
* You need to have https://git-scm.com[git] and https://curl.haxx.se/[curl] installed.
** On Windows you only need to  download and install https://git-scm.com/download/win[git for windows]. This also ships with `bash` and `curl`.
** On Linux you might need to install the above tools in case they are not present (e.g. `sudo apt-get install git curl` or `sudo yum install git-core curl`)
** On MacOS you only need to download and install https://git-scm.com/download/mac[git for mac].

== Download
NOTE: Currently this sonatype download service is broken (`here` link below will not work). As a workaround go to https://github.com/devonfw/ide/releases[releases] and click the latest direct download link. Sorry for any inconvenience.

The latest release of `devonfw-ide` can be downloaded from https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz[here] (You can find all releases in https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/com/devonfw/tools/ide/devonfw-ide-scripts/[maven central]).

== Install
Create a central folder like `C:\projects` or `/projects`. Inside this folder, create a sub-folder for your new project such as `my-project` and extract the contents of the downloaded archive (`devonfw-ide-scripts-*.tar.gz`) to this new folder. Run the command `setup` in this folder (on windows double clicking on `setup.bat`).
That's all. To get started read the link:usage.asciidoc[usage].

== Uninstall
To "uninstall" your `devonfw-ide` you only need to call the following command:
```
devon ide uninstall
```
Then you can delete the `devonfw-ide` top-level folder(s) (link:variables.asciidoc[${DEVON_IDE_HOME}]).

The `devonfw-ide` is designed to be *non-invasive* to your operating system and computer. Therefore it is not "installed" on your system in a classical way. Instead you just create a folder and extract the xref:download[downloaded] archive to it. You only have to install regularly in advance some specific prerequisites like git. All the other softwares remain locally in your devonfw-ide folder. However, there are the following excuses (what is reverted by `devon ide uninstall`):

* The `devon` command is copied to your home directory (`~/.devon/devon`)
* The `devon` alias is added to your shell config (`~/.bashrc` and `~/.zshrc`, search for `alias devon="source ~/.devon/devon"`).
* On Windows the `devon.bat` command is copied to your home directory (`%USERPROFILE%\scripts\devon.bat`)
* On Windows this `%USERPROFILE%\scripts` directory is added to the `PATH` of your user.
* The `devonfw-ide` will download a third party software to your `~/Downloads/devonfw-ide` folder to reduce redundant storage. You have to delete this folder manually as we do not want to be responsible for data-loss in case users manually put files here.

== Testing SNAPSHOT releases

Whenever a story in devonfw-ide is completed by merging a https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests[PR],
our https://github.com/features/actions[github actions] will build a new SNAPSHOT release and on success deploy it to nexus on OSSRH.
You can therefore find the latest devonfw SNAPSHOT releases https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/com/devonfw/tools/ide/devonfw-ide-scripts/[here].
Simply choose the latest SNAPSHOT version folder and then inside the `*.tar.gz` file for the latest version.
Once downloaded, you can proceed as with official releases (see xref:install[install]).

If you test the latest SNAPSHOT please also give feedback to bug or feature tickets to let us know if things are working or not.
Thanks for your testing, support and help to make devonfw better!
