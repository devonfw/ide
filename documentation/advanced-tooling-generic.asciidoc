= Cross-Platform Tooling

== Git Client
If you are looking for a git client that works cross-platform we recommend to use https://git-fork.com/[Fork].

== Draw Diagrams
To draw diagrams for your project or for blueprints in devonfw, we recommend the following cross-platform tools:

* https://draw.io/[draw.io] is a powerful generic vector painting program (similar to visio). You can get a free open-source edition for your desktop from https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-desktop/releases[here].
* https://www.objectaid.com/[ObjectAid] is a nice and easy to use eclipse plugin that you can use to quickly create UML diagrams from existing code. While class-diagrams are supported for free, you need to buy a license if you want to use the other diagram types.
* https://plantuml.com/[PlantUML] is a great tool that can render UML diagrams from simple markup that can be easily managed in `git` or other version-control systems together with your code. Its simplicity allows branching and merging unlike other greedy binary UML data-formats.

== Browser Plugins
There are tons of helpful browser plugins out there and it might be a matter of personal taste what you like to have installed. However, as we are heavily using github we want to promote https://github.com/buunguyen/octotree#octotree[octotree].
In case you also work with `ZenHub` you might want to install the https://www.zenhub.com/extension[Zenhub Browser Extension].
