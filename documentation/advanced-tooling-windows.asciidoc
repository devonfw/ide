= Windows Tooling

== Integration into Windows-Explorer

After you have link:setup.asciidoc[set up] your `devonfw-ide` on a windows machine,
you already have windows-explorer integration out-of-the-box.
Just right-click on the folder you would like to open in a terminal and choose from the context menu:

* `Git Bash`
* `Open devonfw CMD shell here`
* `Open devonfw PowerShell here`
* `Open devonfw Cygwin Bash Here` (only if cygwin was installed during setup)

== Tabs everywhere
Many people got used to _tabs_ that have been introduced by all major browsers:

.Tabs in Firefox

This nice feature can be added to many other tools.

=== Tabs for SSH
If you want to have tabs for your SSH client http://www.putty.org/[Putty] (or even better http://www.9bis.net/kitty/[Kitty] that comes with https://winscp.net/[WinSCP] integration) you simply install https://github.com/jimradford/superputty#superputty-application[SuperPutty]
BTW: Windows 10 has already an SSH client included.

=== Tabs for CMD
If you want to have tabs for your windows command-line you simply install https://conemu.github.io/[ConEmu]. Here you can also add other shells like Putty.
Also you should have a look at the new https://github.com/Microsoft/Terminal[Windows Terminal] which also supports tabs.

See link:guide-integration.asciidoc[] for integration of ConEmu with `devonfw-ide`.

== Windows Helpers

=== Handle passwords
Do you want complex passwords that differ for each account for security? Do you only want to remember a single password for simplicity? Do you want to have both? Then, you need to install https://keepass.info/[KeePass] right now.

=== Real text editor
A real developer needs a real text editor and not windows build in `notepad`.
The most common choice is https://notepad-plus-plus.org/[Notepad++].

=== Real compression tool
Do you need to deal with ZIP files, TGZ, dpkg, etc.? Just install http://www.7-zip.org/[7zip] and forget about windows build-in ZIP support (that is buggy with long file paths, etc.).

=== Smarter clipboard
Do you want to paste something from the clipboard but meanwhile you had to copy something else? Just, one of the many things you can easily do with http://ditto-cp.sourceforge.net/[ditto].

=== Sysinternals Tools
A real developer will quickly notice that windows build in tools to analyze processes, network connections, autostarts, etc. are quite poor. So, what you really would like is the https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysinternals-suite[Sysinternals-Suite]. You can make process-explorer your https://www.ricksdailytips.com/make-process-explorer-default-task-manager/[default task manager]. Use autoruns to prevent nasty background things to be started automatically. Use tcpview to figure out which process is blocking port 8080, etc.

=== Cope with file locks
Did you ever fail to delete a file or directory that was locked by some process and you did not even know which one it was?
Then you might love https://www.iobit.com/en/iobit-unlocker.php[IoBit Unlocker].
See also https://www.howtogeek.com/128680/HOW-TO-DELETE-MOVE-OR-RENAME-LOCKED-FILES-IN-WINDOWS/[this article].

=== Create symbolic links
Are you are used to symbolic and hard links in Linux? Do you have to work with Windows? Would you also like to have such links in Windows? Why not? Windows https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/16226/complete-guide-to-symbolic-links-symlinks-on-windows-or-linux/[supports real links] (not shortcuts like in other cases).
If you even want to have it integrated in windows explorer you might want to install http://schinagl.priv.at/nt/hardlinkshellext/linkshellextension.html[linkshellextension]. However, you might want to disable `SmartMove` in the http://schinagl.priv.at/nt/hardlinkshellext/hardlinkshellext.html#configuration[configuration] if you face strange performance issues when moving folders.

=== Linux
Install https://www.cygwin.com/[Cygwin] and get your bash in windows with ssh-agent, awk, sed, tar, and all the tools you love (or hate). Windows 10 has already a Linux as an installable feature included: WSL and from Version 2004 on WSL2, which is a native Linux Kernel running on Windows (an a light weight VM).

=== X11
Do you want to connect via SSH and need to open an X11 app from the server? Do you want to see the GUI on your windows desktop?
No problem: Install https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/[VcXsrv].

=== Keyboard Freak
Are you a keyboard shortcut person? Do you want to have shortcuts for things like « and » ?
Then you should try https://www.autohotkey.com/[AutoHotKey].
For the example (« and ») you can simply use this script to get started:
```
^<::Send {U+00AB}
^+<::Send {U+00BB}
```
First, just press `[ctrl][<]` and `[ctrl][>]` (`[ctrl][shift][<]`). Next, create shortcuts to launch your IDE, to open your favorite tool, etc.
If you like a GUI to easily configure the scrips, that comes with a lot of extensions preinstalled, you should have a look at https://activaid.telgkamp.de/[Ac'tive Aid].

=== Paint anywhere on your desktop
Do you collaborate sharing your screen, and want to mark a spot on top of what you see? Use http://epic-pen.com/[Epic Pen] to do just that.

=== Analyze graphs
Do you need to visualise complex graph structures? Convert them to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trivial_Graph_Format[Trivial Graph Format] (.tgf), a run https://www.yworks.com/products/yed[yEd] to get an interactive visualization of your graph.

=== Up your screen capture game
Capture any part of your screen with a single click, directly upload to dropbox, or run a svn commit all in one go with http://getgreenshot.org/[Greenshot].
