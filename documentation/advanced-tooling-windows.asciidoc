= Windows Tooling

== Installing software
The devon IDE already contains a lot of software. But if you need more, here are some ways to get it easily:

=== Chocolatey
https://chocolatey.org/[Chocolatey] is a repository for free and open source software similiar to the repositories know from the Linux like apt, apk, pacman, ...

=== Winget
Microsoft is also working on a repository for Windows called https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli[winget]. It is currently in alpha state, but is expected to be integreated in the upcoming Windows 11.

== Integration into Windows-Explorer

After you have link:setup.asciidoc[set up] your `devonfw-ide` on a windows machine,
you already have windows-explorer integration out-of-the-box.
Just right-click on the folder you would like to open in a terminal and choose from the context menu:

* `Git Bash`
* `Open devonfw CMD shell here`
* `Open devonfw PowerShell here`
* `Open devonfw Cygwin Bash Here` (only if cygwin was installed during setup)

== Tabs everywhere
Many people got used to _tabs_ that have been introduced by all major browsers:

.Tabs in Firefox

This nice feature can be added to many other tools.

See link:integration.asciidoc[integration] to make ConEmu work flawless with `devonfw-ide`.

== Windows Helpers

=== Handle passwords
Do you want complex passwords that differ for each account for security? Do you only want to remember a single password for simplicity? Do you want to have both? Then, you need to install https://keepass.info/[KeePass] right now.

=== Real text editor
A real developer needs a real text editor and not windows build in `notepad`.
The most common choice is https://notepad-plus-plus.org/[Notepad++].

=== Real compression tool
Do you need to deal with ZIP files, TGZ, dpkg, etc.? Just install http://www.7-zip.org/[7zip] and forget about windows build-in ZIP support (that is buggy with long file paths, etc.).

=== Smarter clipboard

=== PowerToys
Microsoft provides some extensions to improve the workflow in windows called https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys[PowerToys]. The include tools like a file renamer, a way to order your windows on the screen, a color picker and more.

=== Sysinternals Tools
A real developer will quickly notice that windows build in tools to analyze processes, network connections, autostarts, etc. are quite poor. So, what you really would like is the https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysinternals-suite[Sysinternals-Suite]. You can make process-explorer your https://www.ricksdailytips.com/make-process-explorer-default-task-manager/[default task manager]. Use autoruns to prevent nasty background things to be started automatically. Use tcpview to figure out which process is blocking port 8080, etc.

=== Create symbolic links
Are you are used to symbolic and hard links in Linux? Do you have to work with Windows? Would you also like to have such links in Windows? Why not? Windows https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/16226/complete-guide-to-symbolic-links-symlinks-on-windows-or-linux/[supports real links] (not shortcuts like in other cases).
If you even want to have it integrated in windows explorer you might want to install http://schinagl.priv.at/nt/hardlinkshellext/linkshellextension.html[linkshellextension]. However, you might want to disable `SmartMove` in the http://schinagl.priv.at/nt/hardlinkshellext/hardlinkshellext.html#configuration[configuration] if you face strange performance issues when moving folders.

=== Linux
Install https://www.cygwin.com/[Cygwin] and get your bash in windows with ssh-agent, awk, sed, tar, and all the tools you love (or hate).

=== Keyboard Freak
Are you a keyboard shortcut person? Do you want to have shortcuts for things like « and » ?
Then you should try https://www.autohotkey.com/[AutoHotKey].
For the example (« and ») you can simply use this script to get started:
```
^<::Send {U+00AB}
^+<::Send {U+00BB}
```
First, just press `[ctrl][<]` and `[ctrl][>]` (`[ctrl][shift][<]`). Next, create shortcuts to launch your IDE, to open your favorite tool, etc.
If you like a GUI to easily configure the scrips, that comes with a lot of extensions preinstalled, you should have a look at https://activaid.telgkamp.de/[Ac'tive Aid].
