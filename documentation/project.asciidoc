= project

The `project` commandlet manages projects of your `devonfw-ide`.
You need to supply additional arguments as `devon project «args»`. These are explained by the following table:

.Usage of `devon project`
[options="header"]
|=======================
|*Argument(s)*                   |*Meaning*
|`setup [«project»]`             |setup or update all or the specified project(s)
|=======================

== setup
Run `devon project setup «project»` to setup the link:projects.asciidoc[preconfigured project] `«project»`.
During the initial link:setup.asciidoc[setup] this will happen for all active projects.
Call this command explicitly to setup a project that is not active by default.
Further, if the project has already been setup it will be updated (`git pull`).
In case you omit the project name all (active) projects will be setup/updated.
Use force option (-f) to setup all projects even if not active.

The setup of a project will include:

* clone or pull the project from git into the configured workspace and location
* trigger a build on the project (optional as link:projects.asciidoc[configured])
* import the project into link:eclipse.asciidoc[eclipse] (optional as link:projects.asciidoc[configured])
