= Project import

`IDEasy` supports to automatically check out and import required git repositories (with your source code) into your IDE during link:setup.asciidoc[setup].
To configure this you put a `.properties` file for each desired project into the `repositories` sub-folder in your link:settings.asciidoc[settings].
Each `.properties` file describes one "repository" which you would like to check out and (potentially) import:

[source, properties]
----
path=myproject
workingsets=Set1,Set2
workspace=example
git_url=http://github.com/someorg/someproject
git_branch=develop
build_path=.
build_cmd=mvn -DskipTests=true -Darchetype.test.skip=true clean install
eclipse=import
