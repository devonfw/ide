The https://github.com/devonfw/devon-ide/tree/master/scripts/src/main/resources/scripts/command[command] folder contains the link:cli.asciidoc#commandlets[commandlets].
The https://github.com/devonfw/devon-ide/tree/master/scripts/src/main/resources/scripts/devon[devon] script is the key link:cli.asciidoc[command line interface] for `devon-ide`. For windows there is also https://github.com/devonfw/devon-ide/tree/master/scripts/src/main/resources/scripts/devon.bat[devon.bat] to be used in CMD or PowerShell.
As the `devon` link:cli.asciidoc[CLI] can be used as global command on your computer from any directory and gets link:setup.asciidoc#install[installed] centrally it aims to be stable, minimal, and leightweight. The key logic to setup the environment variables is therefore in a separate script https://github.com/devonfw/devon-ide/tree/master/scripts/src/main/resources/scripts/environment-project[environment-project] and its Windows variant https://github.com/devonfw/devon-ide/tree/master/scripts/src/main/resources/scripts/environment-project.bat[environment-project.bat] inside this `scripts` folder.
The file https://github.com/devonfw/devon-ide/tree/master/scripts/src/main/resources/scripts/functions[functions] contains a collection of reusable bash functions. These are sourced and used by the link:cli.asciidoc#commandlets[commandlets].
Finally the `devon.properties` file contains defaults for the general link:configuration.asciidoc[configuration] of `devon-ide`.
