= Azure CLI

The Azure CLI commandlet allows to install and use https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli[Azure CLI]. Currently, the command works only for Windows.

*ATTENTION:*
Currently this feature is new and therefore experimental.
It may change in incompatible ways in the next releases until we reach a stable state.
We hope that all is working fine for you.
However, do not expect everything to work out of the box.

The arguments (`devon az «args»`) are explained by the following table:
