= Azure CLI

The Azure CLI commandlet allows to install and use https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli[Azure CLI].
Call `devon az «args»` is more or less the same as calling `az «args»` but with some advanced features and ensuring that Azure CLI is properly set up for your project.

*ATTENTION:*
Currently this feature is new and therefore experimental. It only works on windows.
It may change in incompatible ways in the next releases until we reach a stable state.
We hope that all is working fine for you.
However, do not expect everything to work out of the box.

The arguments (`devon az «args»`) are explained by the following table:

.Usage of `devon az`
