= GCViewer

The `gcviewer` commandlet is used to install the GCViewer App if not already installed or launch the App if already installed.
GCViewer is a little tool that visualizes verbose GC (Garbage Collection) output generated by Java Virtual Machines.
To learn more about GC Loggings, please refer to https://sematext.com/blog/java-garbage-collection-logs/ or https://www.baeldung.com/java-gc-logging-to-file.

*ATTENTION:*
Currently this feature is new and therefore experimental.
It may change in incompatible ways in the next releases until we reach a stable state.
We hope that all is working fine for you.
However, do not expect everything to work out of the box.
