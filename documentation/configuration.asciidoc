= Configuration

The `devonfw-ide` aims to be highly configurable and flexible. The configuration of the link:cli.asciidoc[devon] command and environment variables takes place via `devon.properties` files. The following list shows these configuration files in the order they are loaded so files can override variables from files above in the list:

1. build in defaults (for `JAVA_VERSION`, `ECLIPSE_PLUGINS`, etc.)
2. `~/devon.properties` - user specific global defaults (on windows in `%USERPROFILE%/devon.properties`)
3. `https://github.com/devonfw/ide/blob/master/scripts/src/main/resources/scripts/devon.properties[scripts/devon.properties]` - defaults provided by `devonfw-ide`. Never directly modify this file!
4. `devon.properties` - vendor variables for custom distributions of `link:scripts.asciidoc[devonfw-ide-scripts]`, may e.g. tweak `SETTINGS_PATH` or predefine `SETTINGS_URL`.
5. `https://github.com/devonfw/ide-settings/blob/master/devon.properties[settings/devon.properties]` (`${SETTINGS_PATH}/devon.properties`) - project specific configurations from link:settings.asciidoc[settings].
6. `workspaces/${WORKSPACE}/devon.properties` - optional workspace specific configurations (especially helpful in projects using docker).
7. `https://github.com/devonfw/ide-settings/blob/master/devon/conf/devon.properties[conf/devon.properties]` - user specific configurations (e.g. `M2_REPO=~/.m2/repository`). During setup this file is created by copying a template from `${SETTINGS_PATH}/devon/conf/devon.properties`.

== devon.properties

The `devon.properties` files allow to define environment variables in a simple and OS independent way:

* `# comments begin with a hash sign (#) and are ignored`
* `variable_name=variable_value with space etc.`
* `variable_name=${predefined_variable}/folder_name`
+
variable values can refer to other variables that are already defined, which will be resolved to their value. You have to used `${...}` syntax to make it work on all platforms (never use `%...%`, `$...`, or `$(...)` syntax in `devon.properties` files).
* `export exported_variable=this value will be exported in bash, in windows CMD the export prefix is ignored`
* `variable_name=`
+
this will unset the specified variable
* `variable_name=~/some/path/and.file`
+
tilde is resolved to your personal home directory on any OS including windows.
* `array_variable=(value1 value2 value3)`
+
This will only work properly in bash worlds but as no arrays are used in CMD world of `devonfw-ide` it does not hurt on windows.
* Please never surround values with quotes (`var="value"`)
* This format is similar to Java `*.properties` but does not support advanced features as unicode literals, multi-lined values, etc.

In order to know what to configure, have a look at the available link:variables.asciidoc[variables].

Please only tweak configurations that you need to change and take according responsibility. There is a price to pay for flexibility, which means you have to be careful what you do.

Further, you can configure link:mvn.asciidoc[maven] via `conf/settings.xml`. To configure your IDE such as link:eclipse.asciidoc[eclipse] or link:vscode.asciidoc[vscode] you can tweak the link:settings.asciidoc[settings].
