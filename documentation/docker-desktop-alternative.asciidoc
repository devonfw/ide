== Introduction

As https://www.docker.com/blog/updating-product-subscriptions/[Docker Desktop has changed its licensing] we have been looking for a license-free alternative.
This document gives a rationale why we have choosen https://rancherdesktop.io/[Rancher Desktop] as alternative to setup and manage https://www.docker.com/[docker] and https://kubernetes.io/[kubernetes].

== Why we chose Rancher Desktop as Docker-Desktop alternative 

Our main criteria for tool comparision were:

* The softwares licence
* Match of toolset compared to Docker Desktop
* Complexity of installing and setting up the toolset
* Stability of the solution
* Future-proofness (community activitiy, regular updates and fixes)

|======================
|        |*Rancher Desktop*|*Podman-Minikube*|*Others*
|*Pro*   |
- It comes very close to what Docker-Desktop offers, as it installs most of Docker-Desktop's cli-tools  -> Almost frictionless shift +
- Installs and sets up a good toolset including typical docker compnents as well as kubernetes +
- Makes installation and setup very easy +
- Cloud tools like Helm or Terraform are usable +
- Works on macOS, Windows and Linux +
- Comes with a GUI +
- Easy shift between Kubernetes versions via GUI +
- Works with VPN when using https://github.com/sakai135/wsl-vpnkit/[wsl-vpnkit] +
- Licence free
|
- Works deamon less, also OCI-Containers (like Docker) +
- Root less Containers, giving security improvements over Docker +
- Not that hard to install and setup +
- Kubernetes usable locally +
- Licence free
|
Interesting components: +
- e.g. Lazydocker gives a pretty and compact graphical component +
- e.g. MicroK8s as a lightweight, fast version of Kubernetes +
|*Contra*|
-does not have all features Docker Desktop has, like image security scans 
|
- Has most usual Docker-commands, but not all of them +
- For ongoing Docker-projects might not be worth it, because of some differences to Docker -> Porblems during software migration +
- GUI less +
- More work when it comes to implementation +
- minikube only gives us one cluster +
- Does not have all features Docker Desktop has, like image security scans +
|
- In some cases not available for all OS +
- Software often just one component of what we need (like Kind for running Clusters using Docker; Buildah for building Containers...), therefore need to mix tools +
- Especially for a manual mix of tools severe implementation/maintenance increase possible +
- More error-prone, particularly when using a rather uncommon mix of tools +
- Unclear future of some projects +
- Some options were bleeding edge
