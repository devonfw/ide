= GraalVM

The `graalvm` commandlet allows to install and use https://www.graalvm.org/[graalvm]. Calling `devon graalvm gu «args»` is more or less the same as calling `gu «args»` but with the benefit that the version of graalvm preferred by your project is used (and will be installed if not yet available).

*ATTENTION:*
Currently this feature is new and therefore experimental.
It may change in incompatible ways in the next releases until we reach a stable state.
We hope that all is working fine for you.
However, do not expect everything to work out of the box.
In case you are facing issues please give us feedback so we can improve.

The arguments (`devon graalvm «args»`) are explained by the following table:
