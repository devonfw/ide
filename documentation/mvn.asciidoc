= mvn

The `mvn` commandlet allows to install, configure, and launch https://maven.apache.org/[maven]. It is similar to https://github.com/takari/maven-wrapper[maven-wrapper] and https://github.com/dansomething/mdub[mdub]. So calling `devon mvn «args»` is more or less the same as calling `mvn «args»` but with the benefit that the version of maven preferred by your project is used (and will be installed if not yet available).

The arguments (`devon mvn «args»`) are explained by the following table:
