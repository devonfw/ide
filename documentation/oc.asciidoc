= OpenShift CLI

The `oc` commandlet is used to install OpenShift CLI. The instructions on how to use it can be found https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.7/cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.html[here].
Call `devon oc «args»` with the arguments described https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.html#cli-using-cli_cli-developer-commands[here].

*ATTENTION:*
Currently this feature is new and therefore experimental.
It may change in incompatible ways in the next releases until we reach a stable state.
We hope that all is working fine for you.
However, do not expect everything to work out of the box.
