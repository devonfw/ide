= devonfw-ide Quickstart

== Prerequisites
We try to make it as simple as possible for you. However, there are some minimal prerequisites:

* You need to have a tool to extract `*.tar.gz` files (`tar` and `gzip`). On Windows before Version 10 (1803) use https://www.7-zip.org/[7-zip]. On all other platforms this comes out of the box.
* You need to have https://git-scm.com[git] and https://curl.haxx.se/[curl] installed.
** On Windows you only need to  download and install https://git-scm.com/download/win[git for windows]. This also ships with `bash` and `curl`.
** On Linux you might need to install the above tools in case they are not present (e.g. `sudo apt-get install git curl` or `sudo yum install git-core curl`)
** On MacOS you only need to download and install https://git-scm.com/download/mac[git for mac].

== Download
The latest release of `devonfw-ide` can be downloaded from https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.devonfw.tools.ide&a=devonfw-ide-scripts&v=LATEST&p=tar.gz[here] (You can find all releases in https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/com/devonfw/tools/ide/devonfw-ide-scripts/[maven central]).

== Install
* Create a central folder like `C:\projects` or `/projects`. 
* Inside this folder, create a sub-folder for your new project such as `my-project` and extract the contents of the downloaded archive (`devonfw-ide-scripts-*.tar.gz`) to this new folder. Run the command `setup` in this folder (on windows double clicking on `setup.bat`).
* It will ask to enter setting url. Just press ENTER. 
Once installation is complete you will be able to see success message on command-line. Press any key to exit from setup command-line.
