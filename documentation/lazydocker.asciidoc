= lazydocker

The lazydocker commandlet allows to install and use https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker[lazydocker].

*ATTENTION:*
Currently this feature is new and therefore experimental.
It may change in incompatible ways in the next releases until we reach a stable state.
We hope that all is working fine for you.
However, do not expect everything to work out of the box.

The arguments (`devon lazydocker «args»`) are explained by the following table:
