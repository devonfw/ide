= lazydocker

The lazydocker commandlet allows to install and use https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker[lazydocker].

*ATTENTION:*
Currently this feature is new and therefore experimental.
It may change in incompatible ways in the next releases until we reach a stable state.
We hope that all is working fine for you.
However, do not expect everything to work out of the box.
In case you are facing issues (e.g. network problems with Cisco AnyConnect, etc.) please give us feedback so we can improve.

The arguments (`devon lazydocker «args»`) are explained by the following table:
