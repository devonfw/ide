= docker

The `docker` commandlet allows to install and use https://www.docker.com/[docker].
On Windows https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10[WSL 2](Windows Subsystem for Linux) has to be installed properly as a prerequisite.

*ATTENTION:*
Currently this feature is new and therefore experimental.
It may change in incompatible ways in the next releases until we reach a stable state.
We hope that all is working fine for you.
However, do not expect everything to work out of the box.
In case you are facing issues (e.g. network problems with Cisco AnyConnect, etc.) please give us feedback so we can improve.


The arguments (`devon docker «args»`) are explained by the following table:

.Usage of `devon docker`
[options="header"]
|=======================
|*Argument(s)*             |*Meaning*
|`setup`                   |setup Docker (install and verify) as per above flow.
|`«args»`                  |call docker with the specified arguments. Call `docker help` for details or use docker directly as preferred." (`«args»`)
|=======================

== setup
The `docker` commandlet will install `docker` automatically.
Please note that besides the sandbox concept of devonfw-ide this is a global installation on your system.
When uninstalling devonfw-ide, you may have to manually uninstall `docker` and `kubernetes` if you do not need it anymore.

=== requirements
Running docker and especially link:kubectl.asciidoc[kubernetes] on your machine in the background will require quite some resources.
This will allocate at least 2GB of additional RAM.

You will need at least 8GB of total RAM while we recommend to use 16GB+.

You may also tune and scale it to your needs.
When using Docker Desktop (Windows or MacOS) simply go to the https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/#resources[resources tab in the settings].
It will depend on your usage frequency if you want to have it running in the background all the time.
This is a balance between resource utilization and convenience.
If you use docker and kubernetes on your local machine on a daily basis this makes sense.

In case you only use docker rarely, you can save resources by stopping it when not needed after it has been installed.

=== Windows and Mac
To enable or disable autostart, you can launch `Docker Desktop` on Windows or MacOS got to the `Preferences` (gear icon in the title bar). Then in the `General` tab you can check or uncheck the option `Start Docker Desktop when you login` (see also https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/#general[here]). When autostart is disabled and you launch `Docker Desktop` it will notice and ask your to start the service or do this automatically for you.
On Windows you can also manually tweak this:

* Hit `[windows][r]`
* Enter `services.msc`
* Confirm with `OK`
* In the services app search for the `Docker Desktop Service` in the list and select it.
* Now you can start or stop the service by clicking on the according link text.
* Also when right clicking on `Docker Desktop Service` and selecting `Options` from the context-menu, you can change the start type to `automatic` or `manual`.

==== Mac A1
In case you have a new Mac with A1 CPU, we automatically download and install the according ARM version of `Docker Desktop for Mac`.
However, if you use docker and search for images you may end up with errors like:
```
docker: no matching manifest for linux/arm64/v8 in the manifest list entries.
```

So with A1 CPU you may need to add `--platform linux/x86_64` as option to your docker command to find the expected container image.

=== Linux
There is no Docker Desktop for Linux.
As docker initially comes from the Linux world, it is easy to set it up on a Linux machine and use it from the commandline.
Therefore we do not install a GUI for you in case you are a Linux user.
In case you need a GUI for docker and kubernetes on Linux you can choose from the following options:

* https://dockstation.io/[DockStation]
* https://portainer.io/[Portainer]
* https://kitematic.com/[Kitematic]
* https://shipyard-project.com/[Shipyard]

== usage
Once installed via setup, you can run docker directly from any shell of your OS directly.
Run `docker help` to get started and use the online documentations and resources on the web to get familiar with docker.
It is not our intention to repeat this here.

Please note that the `docker` commandlet is a link:cli.asciidoc#command-wrapper[command wrapper].
