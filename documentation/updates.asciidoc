= updates

The `updates` folder is used for temporary data. This includes: 

* extracted archives for installation and updates
* backups of old content on updates to prevent data loss

If all works fine you may clean this folder to save some kilo- or mega-bytes. Otherwise you can ignore it unless you are looking for a backup after a failed or unplanned upgrade.
